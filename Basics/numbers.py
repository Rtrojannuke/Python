#numerical values can be saved in variable just by:
num = 20
game = 30

#floating values can be saved in variables just by:
gam = 34.6
trynum = 7.0

#Arithmetic operations can be performed in the following ways
a = 10
b = 16

#Additon is handled using the + sign
c = a + b
print("C is: ",c)
print(a+b)

#Subtraction can be done by
d = a - b
print("D is: ",d)
print(a-b)

#multiplication can be done by using the * sign
f = a * b
print("F is: ",f)
print(a*b)

#division can be done by using the / sign
e = a/b
print("E is: ",e)
print(a/b)

#Raise to power can be done by using ** sysmbol
g = a**2
print("G is: ",g)

#Remainder of a division can also be gotten by using %
h = b%a
print("H is: ",h)

#Order of precednce(what to be executed first) in python is bracket first,then multiplcation, division, addition and subtraction
m = 3+2*6/4
n = (3+2)*6/4
print("M is: ",m)
print("N is: ",n)


#increment can be done in any of the following way
x = 60
print("X is: ",x)
v = 0
v += x
print("V is: ",v)
i = 0
i -= x
print("I is: ",i)
